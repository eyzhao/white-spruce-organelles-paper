# Abstract

The genome sequences of the plastid and mitochondrion of white spruce (*Picea
glauca*) are assembled from whole genome Illumina sequencing data using ABySS.
Whole genome sequencing data contains reads from both the nuclear and organellar
genomes. Reads of the organellar genomes are abundant, because each cell
contains hundreds of mitochondria and plastids. One lane of MiSeq data assembles
the 123 kbp plastid genome in a single contig, and one lane of HiSeq data
assembles a putative 5.9 Mbp mitochondrial genome. The raw assembly is expected
to be composed of organellar sequence as well as nuclear repeat elements. The
organellar sequences are separated from the assembly by classifying the
sequences using their length, depth of coverage and GC content. The genes and
repeats of the plastid and mitochondrial genomes are annotated using MAKER-P.

Introduction
============

Plant cells contain two organelles located in the cytoplasm that harbour their
own genomes, the mitochondrion and the plastid (chloroplast). It can be
difficult to infer phylogenetic trees from nuclear genes of polyploid species
"with large genomes and complex gene families, such as gymnosperms" (Yang et al.
2012). Non-coding regions of plastid DNA (cpDNA) have secondary RNA structures
with regions that are highly variable in gymnosperm that make it suitable for
phylogenetic inference (Hao et al. 2010).

Mitochondrial genomes are inherited maternally from seeds in *Pinaceae*, and
plastid genomes are inherited paternally from pollen (Whittle & Johnston 2002).
These contrasting inheritance schemes can be useful in phylogenetic comparisons
of species expanding their range. In the case of two previously allopatric
species now found in sympatry, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is contributed by
the resident species, whereas introgression of the plastid genome into the
expanding species is limited, since pollen is more readily dispersed than seeds
(Du et al. 2011). Differential gene flow of cpDNA and mtDNA due to different
methods of inheritance and dispersion results in new assemblages of organellar
genomes and an increase of genetic diversity after expansion from a refugium
(Gerardi et al. 2010).

Analysis of cpDNA is useful reconstructing phylogenetic trees of diverse plant
species (Wu et al. 2007), in determining the origin of an expanding population
(Aizawa et al. 2012) and determining when distinct lineages of a species
resulted from multiple colonization events (Jard<span>รณ</span>n-Barbolla et al.
2011).

The complete plastid genomes of the gymnosperms *Podocarpus lambertii*, *Taxus
chinensis* var. *mairei* and four *Juniperus* species were submitted to NCBI
GenBank in 2014 (Nascimento Vieira, Faoro, Rogalski, et al. 2014; Zhang et al.
2014; Guo et al. 2014). These projects used a variety of strategies for
isolating cpDNA either in the lab or computationally, sequencing and assembly.
The *P. lambertii* genome assembly isolated the cpDNA using the protocol of
Nascimento Vieira, Faoro, Freitas Fraga, et al. (2014), Illumina MiSeq
sequencing and Newbler to assemble the reads. The *Juniperus bermudiana* genome
assembly used long-range PCR to amplify the plastid DNA, a combination of
Illumina GAII and Sanger sequencing, and Geneious to assemble the reads using
*C. japonica* as a reference genome. The other three *Juniperus* genome
assemblies used Illumina MiSeq sequencing and Velvet (Zerbino & Birney 2008) to
assemble the reads. The *T. chinensis* genome assembly used whole-genome
Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing, BLAT (Kent 2002) to isolate the cpDNA reads and
SOAPdenovo (Luo et al. 2012) to assemble the isolated cpDNA reads. All of these
projects used DOGMA (Wyman et al. 2004) to annotate the assembly.

Only one complete mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm has been published,
*Cycas taitungensis* (Chaw et al. 2008). In 2014 the complete mitochondrial
genomes of the spermatophytes *Brassica maritima*, *Brassica oleracea*,
*Capsicum annuum*, *Eruca sativa*, *Helianthus tuberosus*, *Raphanus sativus*,
*Rhazya stricta* and *Vaccinium macrocarpon* were submitted to NCBI Genbank
(Grewe et al. 2014; Jo et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Bock et al. 2014; Jeong et
al. 2014; Park et al. 2014; Fajardo et al. 2014). Six of these projects gave
details of the sample preparation, sequencing, assembly and annotation strategy.
Three projects enriched for organelle DNA using varying laboratory methods
(Keren et al. 2009; Kim et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2011), and the remainder used
total genomic DNA. Three projects used Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing and Velvet
for assembly, and three projects used Roche 454 GS-FLX sequencing and Newbler
for assembly. Most projects used an aligner such as BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990)
to isolate sequences with similarity to known mitochondrial sequence, either
before or after assembly. Two projects used Mitofy (Alverson et al. 2010) to
annotate the genome, and the remainder used a collection of tools such as BLAST,
tRNAscan-SE (Lowe & Eddy 1997) and ORF Finder to annotate genes.

Three further spcecies are of note for the large size of their mitochondrial
genomes. The mitochondrial genome of *Amborella trichopoda* is 3.9 Mbp, and
additionally "it is the single sister species to all other extant angiosperms"
(Rice et al. 2013). The mitochondrial genomes of *Silene noctiflora* and *Silene
conica* are 6.7 Mbp and 11.3 Mbp respecitvely (Sloan et al. 2012).

The SMarTForests project published the draft genome sequence of the 20 gigabase
white spruce (*Picea glauca*) genome (Birol et al. 2013), seven times the size
of the human genome, sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq sequencing
platforms. Whole genome sequencing data contains reads originating from both the
nuclear and organellar genomes. Whereas one copy of the diploid nuclear genome
is found in each cell, hundreds of organelles are present, and thus hundreds of
copies of the organellar genomes. This abundance results in an
overrepresentation of the organellar genomes in whole genome sequencing data.

Assembling a single lane of whole genome sequencing data using ABySS (Simpson et
al. 2009) yields an assembly composed of organellar sequences and nuclear repeat
elements. The assembled sequences that originate from the organellar genomes are
separated from those of nuclear origin by classifying the sequences using their
length, depth of coverage and GC content. The organellar genomes of white spruce
are compared to those of Norway spruce (*Picea abies*) (Nystedt et al. 2013).

Methods
=======

The software used in this analysis, their versions and the digital object
identifiers (DOI) of their respective publications are listed in supplementary
Table S1.

Plastid
-------

The overlapping paired-end reads were merged using ABySS-mergepairs. These
merged reads were assembled using
[ABySS](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1117). Contigs that are putatively
derived from the plastid were separated by length and depth of coverage using
thresholds chosen by inspection (see supplementary Figure S1). These putative
plastid contigs were assembled into scaffolds using ABySS-scaffold. The
assembled plastid genome was initially annotated using
[DOGMA](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/17/3252), but DOGMA
is an interactive web application, which is not convenient for an automated
pipeline. We instead used
[MAKER-P](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2013/12/06/pp.113.230144)
for annotation, which is intended for automated pipelines, and used the [Norway
spruce](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12211.html)
complete plastid genome
([NC\_021456](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_021456)) for both
protein-coding and non-coding gene homology evidence. The parameters of MAKER
are show in supplementary Table S2. The inverted repeat was identified using
[MUMmer](http://genomebiology.com/content/5/2/R12), shown in supplementary
Figure S3.

The assembled plastid genome was aligned to the Norway spruce plastid using
[BWA-MEM](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3997.pdf). Coverage and identity of these
alignments were calculated using the script `bam-identity` (see supplementary
materials). The two genomes were compared using
[QUAST](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/8/1072) to confirm
the presence of the annotated genes of the Norway spruce plastid in the white
spruce plastid.

Mitochondrion
-------------

ABySS-konnector was used to fill the gap between the paired-end reads of a
single lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing of a paired-end library. These
connected paired-end reads were assembled using
[ABySS](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/6/1117). Putative mitochondrial
sequences were separated from the assembly by their length, depth of coverage
and GC content using k-means clustering in R (see supplementary Figure S2).
These putative mitochondrial contigs were then assembled into scaffolds using
ABySS-scaffold with a single lane of Illumina HiSeq sequencing of a mate-pair
library.

The mitochondrial genome was annotated using
[MAKER-P](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2013/12/06/pp.113.230144)
(parameters shown in supplementary Table S3). The proteins of all green plants
(viridiplantae) with complete mitochondrial genome sequences in NCBI GenBank, 51
species, were used for protein homology evidence and aligned using
[BLAST](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605803602) and
[Exonerate](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/31). The [prince sago palm
(Cycas taitungensis)
mitochondrion](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/3/603.short)
([NC\_010303](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_010303)) is the closest
related species, being the only gymnosperm with a complete mitochondrial genome.
Transfer RNA (tRNA) were annotated using
[tRNAscan](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/5/0955). Ribosomal RNA
(rRNA) were annotated using
[Barrnap](http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/software.barrnap.shtml). Repeats were
identified using [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/) and RepeatModeler.

The putative mitochondrial sequences of white spruce were aligned to the
putative mitochondrial sequences of the [Norway
spruce](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature12211.html)
using [BWA-MEM](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.3997.pdf). Coverage and identity of
these alignments were calculated using the script `bam-identity` (see
supplementary materials).

Plastid
-------

The plastid genome was assembled into a single circular contig of 123,266 bp.
The assembly metrics are shown in [Table 1](#table-1). The plastid genome
contains 114 genes: 74 protein coding (mRNA) genes, 36 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes
and 4 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1).

All protein-coding genes are single copy, except *psbI* and *ycf12*, which have
two copies each. All tRNA genes are single copy, except *trnH-GUG*, *trnI-CAU*,
*trnS-GCU* and *trnT-GGU*, which have two copies each. All rRNA genes are single
copy.

The protein-coding genes *atpF*, *petB*, *petD*, *rpl2*, *rpl16*, *rpoC1* and
*rps12* each contain one intron, and *ycf3* contains two introns. The tRNA genes
*trnA-UGC*, *trnG-GCC*, *trnI-GAU*, *trnK-UUU*, *trnL-UAA* and *trnV-UAC* each
contain one intron. The rRNA genes are not spliced.

The first and smallest exons of the genes *petB*, *petD* and *rpl16* are 6, 8
and 9 bp respectively. These genes likely belong to [polycistronic
transcripts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC457051/) of their
respective protein complexes, but the short size of their initial exons make
them difficult to annotate all the same. The initial exons of these genes were
added to their annotations manually.

The gene *rps12* of a plastid genome is typically
[trans-spliced](http://www.pnas.org/content/85/2/372.short), which makes it
difficult to annotate using
[MAKER](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/early/2013/12/06/pp.113.230144). It
is composed of three exons and one cis-spliced intron. It required manually
editing the gene annotation to incorporate trans-splicing in the gene model.

Each copy of the inverted repeat (IR) is 445 bp in size, much smaller than most
plants, but typical of *Pinaceae* ([Lin,
2010](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/504)). Unlike most inverted
repeats, which are typically identical, the two copies differ by a single base.
The IR contains a single gene, the tRNA *trnI-CAU*.

All 114 genes of the Norway spruce plastid genome
([NC\_021456](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_021456)) are present in the
white spruce plastid genome. The genomes of the white spruce plastid and Norway
spruce plastid show perfect gene synteny with no structural rearrangements.

and plotted using
[OGDRAW](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/W1/W575).](figure/plastid-annotation.png)

Mitochondrion
-------------

The mitochondrial genome was assembled into 61 scaffolds (223 contigs,
permitting gaps less than 500 bp) with a scaffold N50 of 287 kbp (contig N50 of
39 kbp). The largest scaffold is 598 kbp. The assembly metrics are shown in
[Table 1](#table-1).

The mitochondrial genome contains 54 protein coding (mRNA) genes, 23 transfer
RNA (tRNA) genes and 4 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, shown in [Figure
2](#figure-2). The coding genes compose 50 kbp (\<1%) of the genome, shown in
[Figure 3](#figure-3).

The protein-coding genes *atp8*, *cox1*, *matR*, *nad7*, *rpl10*, *rps1* and
*rps4* each contain one intron, and *ccmFn*, *nad4*, *nad5* and *rps3-2* each
contain two introns.

The putative mitochondrial sequences of white spruce and Norway spruce show high
sequence similarity, over 98% nucleotide identity, but only 60% of the Norway
spruce putative mitochondrial sequences are covered by alignments of the white
spruce sequences.

Repeats compose 400 kbp (~7%) of the mitochondrial genome. Simple repeats, the
LINE Jockey and the LTR Copia and Gypsy are the most common repeats, shown in
[Figure 4](#figure-4).

Conclusion
==========

One lane of MiSeq sequencing of whole genome DNA is sufficient to assemble the
123 kbp complete plastid genome, and one lane of HiSeq sequencing of whole
genome DNA is sufficient to assemble a draft 5.9 Mbp mitochondrial genome of
white spruce. Scaffold contiguity is improved with additional mate-pair library
sequencing. The resulting assembly of whole genome sequencing data is composed
of organellar sequences as well as high-copy-number nuclear repeat elements. The
mitochondrial sequences are separated using a k-means classifier based on their
length, depth of coverage and GC content of the sequences.

The white spruce plastid genome shows no structural rearrangements when compared
with Norway spruce. The mitochondrial genome in contrast shows much structural
rearrangement, though more work is needed to determine what is due to the draft
nature of these mitochondrial assemblies and what is true structural
rearrangement.

The protein coding gene content of the mitochondrial genome is quite sparse,
with 54 protein coding genes in 5.9 Mbp, in comparison to the plastid genome,
with 74 protein coding genes in 123 kbp. 7% of the mitochondrial genome is
composed of repeats, and \<1% is composed of coding genes. A significant
portion, over 90%, of the unusually large size of the white spruce mitochondrial
genome is yet unexplained.
